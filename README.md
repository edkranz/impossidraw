# Impossidraw

A design tool for creating portal-based impossible spaces. 

The tool ensures maximum room size is respected, and portal positions are correct, with corresponding portals always being in the same position relative to their enclosing room. 

Also allows you to export as a 3D model, by extruding the walls, with wall thickness and height configurable.

Built in [React](https://github.com/facebook/react) with [Konva](https://github.com/konvajs/konva) and [three.js](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js)
